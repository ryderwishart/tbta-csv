Let each person know that I have done all of these things because you commanded me to do them.",,,

723,1 Kings 20:32,"So the officials wore the rough clothes that people wear when they are sad. They tied ropes around their heads. Then they went to the king of Israel.

724,1 Kings 20:33,"The officials thought that that thing was good news. So they used quickly that same thing that Ahab had used. They said, “Yes!
