1,Analysis Conventions,"  When editing Easy English text into TBTAese, certain conventions are used in order to simplify both the manual editing of the Easy English text as well as the semi-automatic semantic analysis.  Listed below are topics with examples.  The examples illustrate exactly how the revised Easy English text should be entered.   Direct Quotes     Single sentence direct quotes:  John said, [""Mary read that book""].  John asked, [""Did Mary read that book?""]  John shouted, [""Mary read this book!""]     Multi-sentence direct quotes:     John said, [""Mary read that book]. Then Peter read this book.""     The guideline to remember with quotation marks is that they are always inside the brackets.  Punctuation     Commas        Addressee NPs are followed by a comma:  John, Mary read this book.        Coordinate NPs are followed by commas:  John saw Mary, Peter, Steve, and Susan.     Question Marks        Yes/No questions end with a question mark:  Did John read that book?        Content questions end with a question mark:  Why did John read that book?     Exclamation Marks        Exclamation marks may be placed at the end of a proposition: John read this book!   Imperatives     Imperatives begin with a second person pronoun (singular or plural) and have '(imp)' somewhere in the proposition:         singular second person pronoun:  You(John) (imp) read this book.          Plural second person pronoun:  You(students) (imp) read these books.  Pronouns     Personal Pronouns        First and Second Person pronouns always have a referent in parentheses: I(John) read this book.  You(Mary) read this book.        There are no third person pronouns in the semantic representations:  [After John read this book] John read that book.  (no 'he' in main clause)     Possessive Pronouns        First and second person possessive pronouns have a referent in parentheses: My(John's) book is there.  Your(students') books are there.        There are no third person possessive pronouns in the semantic representations: John read John's book.  ('his' and 'their' are not allowed)     Reciprocal Pronouns        Reciprocal pronouns have a referent in parentheses: The women asked each-other(women), [""Is this woman Naomi?]""     Reflexive Pronouns        First and second person reflexive pronouns have a referent in parentheses:  We(students) saw ourselves(students).  You(students) saw yourselves(students).        There are no third person reflexive pronouns in the semantic representations:  John saw John.  The people saw the people.  ('himself' and 'themselves' are not allowed)     Reciprocal Pronouns         The reciprocal pronoun has a referent in parentheses:  The people talked to each-other(people).     Relative Pronouns - see discussion under Subordinate Clauses - Relative.     Subordinate Clauses        All subordinate clauses (relative clauses, object complements, attributive complements, and adverbial clauses) are marked with brackets ('[' and ']').        Relative clauses:  relative clauses always begin with a relativizer ('that,' 'where,' 'when,' or 'than') or a relative pronoun ('who' or 'whom').           The man [that John saw] read this book.  (relativizer is 'that'; do not supply NP-Rel).           The house [where John lives] is in Dallas.   (relativizer is 'where') (equivalent to: The house [that John lives in] is in Dallas.)           The day [when John left Dallas] was June 2nd.  (relativizer is 'when')  (equivalent to: The day [that John left Dallas on] was June 2nd.)           The people [who live in Dallas] read many books.

(relative pronoun is 'whom')  (equivalent to: The people [that John saw] live in Dallas.)        Object complements:  object complements may include the complementizer ('that'), and may be fully propositional or highly merged.            John thinks [that Mary might read this book].  (complementizer is 'that', agent of object complement is included, verb is fully inflected)            John told [Mary to read this book].   (no complementizer is necessary, verb is non-finite)            John wants [to read this book].        (no complementizer, no agent in complement clause, verb is non-finite)        Attributive complements:  attributive complements are clausal arguments of adjectives            John is afraid [to read that book].            John is afraid [that Mary will read that book].  (complementizer is 'that')        Adverbial clauses:             [Before John read this book] John read that book.             [After Mary read this book] John read that book.             Etc.",
